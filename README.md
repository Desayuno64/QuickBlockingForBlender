Hi, thanks for giving my nodes a try.

I reccomend appending this file as a collection, the default comes with everything setted up so you can blockout in no time.
having a workflow of 2 objects and one linked mesh, as your main blocking and the other one as a collider, 
this is already set up in the Geometry nodes modifier, but if you clean import, you'l have to set it up a bit.

You can use the crease edges to delete unwanted rails, and any vertex paint you make to the blocking will transfer to the end results.
